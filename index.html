<h1>What college you would like to attend & why?</h1>
<p>I wouldnt like to attend college, for I feel like I would learn the necessary skills to overall skip college and learn in a field that I would be able to qualify in, but if I go to college, I would like to attend YSU or something close to home.</p>
<h1>What you would like to study?</h1>
<p>I would like to study more Software Engineering once I leave highschool, so I can further my knowledge, or see what oppurtunites are out there for me.</p>
<h1>What type of work you would like to do after your graduate.</h1>
<p>Probably try to find work or relax for a little, I just need to make sure that I dont't waste too much time or I won't be able to use my knowledge that I had acquired.</p>
